### Structure of presos

- First two preso should be about the same topic, while the first is for beginners and second one is about the hard parts.
- The third preso should be about a fun project you are messing with. (like [nodebots](http://nodebots.io/) or [nodecopters](http://nodecopter.com/))

### I want to give a presentation about [insert here your favourite tool, module here], what should I do?

- Open an issue at [nodebp/nodebp](https://github.com/nodebp/nodebp/issues/new), submit your proposal and the community can vote:)

### Ohh I just gave a talk, how should I upload it?

- Create a repo under your name, name it as you want (please if you have code and slides try to put into different branches)
- Open an issue at [nodebp/nodebp](https://github.com/nodebp/nodebp/issues/new) asking to fork your repo
- We will do the rest. :) thanks for your awesome work:)
